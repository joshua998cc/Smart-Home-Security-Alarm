Using a bread board, Ultra Sonic Sensor, LED Lights, and proper wiring connectivity. I created a smart home security alarm system using the Arduino IDE to program the instructions for the the device. I could manipulate the distance at which the sensor would trigger the alarm. Modify when the Automatic lights would switch on during the time of day for night visibility. The device contained a door sensor as well to read when the door was opened or closed along with a distance sensor to monitor for a possible home intruder.
