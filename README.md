Using a bread board, Ultra Sonic Sensor, LED Lights, and proper wiring connectivity. I created a smart home security alarm system using the Arduino IDE to program the instructions for the the device. I could manipulate the distance at which the sensor would trigger the alarm. Modify when the Automatic lights would switch on during the time of day for night visibility. Trigger the alarm when the door would open when armed.
